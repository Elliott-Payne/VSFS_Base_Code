The recent phone call between President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu marks a significant shift in the relationship dynamics between the two allies. Biden's assertion of the unacceptability of the strikes on humanitarian workers in Gaza reflects a heightened level of frustration within the Biden administration regarding Israel's military campaign.

The White House's statement following the call underscores the seriousness of the situation, indicating that US policy towards Gaza will be contingent upon Israel's immediate actions to address civilian harm and humanitarian suffering. This stance suggests that the US may be considering changes in its policy towards Israel if these concerns are not adequately addressed.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken's remarks further emphasize the gravity of the situation, indicating that failure to see the necessary changes may result in alterations to US policy. Blinken's assertion that Israel, as a democracy, should uphold the highest value of human life underscores the moral dimension of the issue.

However, despite the rhetoric and expressions of concern, the US's continued arms sales to Israel raise questions about the consistency of its position. The sale of fighter jets and bombs to Israel, despite the ongoing humanitarian crisis, highlights the complexity of US-Israel relations and the challenges of balancing strategic interests with humanitarian concerns.

Senator Chris Coons' openness to applying conditions to aid for Israel reflects a growing sentiment within the Democratic Party to reassess the unconditional support traditionally extended to Israel. This shift in attitude suggests a potential divergence between the Biden administration and some members of Congress regarding the approach to US-Israel relations.

Overall, while President Biden's call for a temporary ceasefire and emphasis on humanitarian concerns demonstrates a willingness to engage diplomatically, the lack of a clear stance on a permanent ceasefire raises questions about the administration's long-term strategy and alignment with international consensus on resolving the conflict.
